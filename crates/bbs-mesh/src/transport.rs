    // ── Deduplicate retransmissions ───────────────────────────────────────────
    // Prefer the sender's per-message timestamp: a retransmission reuses it, so
    // matching on (timestamp, text) drops resends robustly — even ones delayed
    // past the text-only window or arriving after the workflow state changed
    // (the "Error: Already logged in" symptom). When the sender supplies no
    // timestamp (0), fall back to the text-only window, which additionally
    // guards mesh retransmissions of a workflow reply that land after the
    // workflow has completed.
    //
    // The `on_dedup_drop_*` counters here are DIAGNOSTIC ONLY — they do not
    // change behaviour. They let an operator see, from the field, how often the
    // dedup fires on a given node's traffic. The timestamp we key on is whatever
    // the ORIGIN stamped: both bridge implementations preserve the packet's
    // embedded sender timestamp on receive (firmware `queueMessage` copies
    // `sender_timestamp` verbatim; pyMC's text handler extracts it from the
    // decrypted payload), so collision risk is set by the SENDING side. Senders
    // attached to real firmware get the app-supplied stamp passed through
    // unchanged (apps observed in the field stamp distinct sends distinctly, and
    // firmware stamps CLI data with strictly-increasing `getCurrentTimeUnique`).
    // Senders bridged through pyMC, however, are RE-stamped whole-second
    // `int(time.time())` at send time — pyMC's CMD_SEND_TXT_MSG handler discards
    // the client's own timestamp bytes — so two distinct, byte-identical sends
    // from such a sender in the same second collide on the (timestamp, text) key
    // and the second is dropped here. That is a property of the sender's bridge,
    // not of ours. Whether it ever drops *legitimate* traffic in practice is
    // what these counters measure; the behavioural fix (if the data shows one is
    // warranted) is deliberately deferred, because a same-second confirmation is
    // on-the-wire indistinguishable from a stale retransmission of the command
    // that triggered the prompt, so no transport-layer rule can tell them apart
    // (see the tests `identical_workflow_replies_with_same_timestamp_dedup_second`
    // and `real_host_register_double_send_then_password`, which demand opposite
