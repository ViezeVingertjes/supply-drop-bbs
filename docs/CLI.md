# CLI reference - `supply-drop-bbs`

Complete reference for every subcommand and flag.

## Synopsis

```
supply-drop-bbs [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]
```

Omitting the subcommand is the same as `supply-drop-bbs run`.

---

## Global options

These options are accepted by every subcommand.

| Flag | Env override | Default | Description |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `--config <PATH>` | - | see below | Path to the TOML config file |
| `--data-dir <PATH>` | `SUPPLY_DROP__BBS__DATA_DIR` | `<config data_dir>` | Override the data directory (database, logs, backups) |
| `--log-level <LEVEL>` | `SUPPLY_DROP__LOGGING__LEVEL` | `INFO` | Log verbosity: `TRACE` `DEBUG` `INFO` `WARN` `ERROR` |
| `--version` | - | - | Print version and exit |
| `--help` / `-h` | - | - | Print help and exit |

### Config file search order

When `--config` is not given the BBS looks for a config file in this order, stopping at the first one found:

1. `./config.toml`
2. `/etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml`
3. `~/.config/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml`

If none exists, compiled-in defaults are used. An empty or missing config file is always valid.

### `--data-dir` behaviour

Setting `--data-dir` clears any database path, log file path, and backup directory that were set in the config file - they are re-derived under the new data directory. If you need an explicit database path alongside a different data directory, set both `data_dir` and `database.path` in the TOML file instead.

---

## Subcommands

### `run`

```
supply-drop-bbs run [OPTIONS]
```

Start the BBS. This is the default when no subcommand is given - the following two commands are equivalent:

```sh
supply-drop-bbs
supply-drop-bbs run
```

**What it does:**

1. Loads and resolves configuration
2. Initialises tracing / logging
3. Creates the data directory if it does not exist
4. Opens (and migrates) the SQLite database
5. Constructs the BBS host
6. Starts compiled-in transport plugins (mesh, CLI, web admin)
7. Blocks until `Ctrl-C` or `SIGTERM`
8. Stops plugins in reverse order and exits cleanly

**Examples:**

```sh
# Systemd service - normal production invocation
supply-drop-bbs run --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml

# Development - verbose logging, local data directory
supply-drop-bbs run --data-dir ./dev-data --log-level debug

# Override log level via environment
SUPPLY_DROP__LOGGING__LEVEL=trace supply-drop-bbs run
```

---

### `setup`

```
supply-drop-bbs setup [OPTIONS]
```

Run the interactive first-run setup wizard. Detects your radio device, asks configuration questions, and writes a `config.toml`. Safe to run on an existing installation - answers are pre-populated from the current config.

The wizard asks:

1. Radio connection type — USB serial or Pi HAT
2. Serial port *(USB only)* — auto-detected; you confirm or enter manually
3. Radio parameters *(USB serial only)* — choose a named region preset or enter custom values (frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, TX power); stored in `[plugins.mesh.radio]` and applied to the device; can be re-applied later with `node set-radio`
4. BBS name — shown to users on connect
5. Data directory — defaults to `/var/lib/supply-drop-bbs`
6. Web admin UI — whether to enable it, bind address, and backup directory

After the wizard completes, restart the service to apply:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart supply-drop-bbs
```

**Example:**

```sh
sudo supply-drop-bbs setup --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
```

---

### `config check`

```
supply-drop-bbs config check [OPTIONS]
```

Validate the config file and exit. Exit code `0` means the config is valid; non-zero means it is not.

```sh
supply-drop-bbs config check
# config OK

supply-drop-bbs config check --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
# config OK
```

Use this before restarting the service after an edit:

```sh
supply-drop-bbs config check && sudo systemctl restart supply-drop-bbs
```

---

### `config show`

```
supply-drop-bbs config show [OPTIONS]
```

Print the effective configuration as TOML - compiled-in defaults, config file values, and environment overrides all merged and displayed together. Useful for verifying that overrides are applied correctly.

```sh
supply-drop-bbs config show
supply-drop-bbs config show --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
SUPPLY_DROP__BBS__DATA_DIR=/tmp/test supply-drop-bbs config show
```

### `config require-verify`

```
supply-drop-bbs config require-verify <on|off> [OPTIONS]
```

Enable or disable sysop verification for new registrations. Writes `require_verify` to the `[bbs]` section of the config file. **Takes effect on the next BBS restart.**

| Argument | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `on` | New accounts must be verified by an aide or sysop before they can access rooms (default) |
| `off` | New accounts are treated as `User` immediately — no verification step required (SHTF mode) |

```sh
# Disable verification for emergency / SHTF deployments
sudo supply-drop-bbs config require-verify off \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml

# Restore normal verification
sudo supply-drop-bbs config require-verify on \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
```

> **Tip:** Use the in-BBS sysop command `OPENACCESS` / `CLOSEACCESS` instead if you need the change to take effect immediately without a restart.

---

### `config guest-room`

```
supply-drop-bbs config guest-room <name|off> [OPTIONS]
```

Set or clear the guest room. Writes (or removes) `guest_room` in the `[bbs]` section of the config file. **Takes effect on the next BBS restart.**

When a guest room is configured, unverified users are placed in that room after registration and can only read and post there. All other rooms and mail are invisible until a sysop verifies them. The room is created automatically on startup if it does not already exist.

| Argument | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `<name>` | Room name to use as the guest room (e.g. `Guests`) |
| `off` | Disable the guest room feature |

```sh
# Set a guest room
sudo supply-drop-bbs config guest-room Guests \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml

# Disable
sudo supply-drop-bbs config guest-room off \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
```

> **Tip:** Use the in-BBS sysop command `GUESTROOM <name>` / `GUESTROOM OFF` for an immediate live change without a restart.

---

### `migrate`

```
supply-drop-bbs migrate [OPTIONS]
```

Apply any pending database migrations and exit. The `run` subcommand always migrates on startup, so this is only needed if you want to migrate without starting the BBS (e.g. as a pre-flight step in a deployment script).

```
exit 0   migrations applied (or already up to date)
exit 1   database could not be opened or a migration failed
```

Example deployment sequence:

```sh
supply-drop-bbs migrate --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
supply-drop-bbs run    --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
```

---

### `backup`

```
supply-drop-bbs backup [OPTIONS]
```

Trigger an immediate database backup (`VACUUM INTO`) and exit. The backup lands in `<data_dir>/backups/` (or the configured `[backup] directory`) with a timestamp filename. The running BBS service does not need to be stopped — `VACUUM INTO` is non-blocking and consistent.

On success, prints the filename, size in bytes, and destination directory:

```
Backup created: backup_20260511_142301.db
  size:     2097152 bytes
  location: /var/lib/supply-drop-bbs/backups
```

---

### `node show-key`

```
supply-drop-bbs node show-key [OPTIONS]
```

Connect to the MeshCore device via USB serial, perform the handshake, and print the node's 32-byte **public key** as a 64-character hex string. This is the key other mesh nodes use to contact your BBS.

Works for both `connection_type = "serial"` (companion firmware) and `connection_type = "kiss"` (KISS Modem firmware); the port defaults to `serial_port` in either case.

The BBS service must **not** be running on the same serial port when you run this.

```sh
supply-drop-bbs node show-key
# ab12cd34ef56...  (64 hex chars)

supply-drop-bbs node show-key --port /dev/ttyACM0
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--port <PATH>` | Serial port (e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0`, `COM3`). Defaults to the port in `config.toml`. |
| `--baud <N>` | Baud rate. Defaults to `config.toml` value or `115200`. |

---

### `node export-key`

```
supply-drop-bbs node export-key [OPTIONS]
```

Export the companion device's 32-byte **private key** as a 64-character hex string. Back up this value before a firmware flash or hardware migration — it is the only way to restore your node's mesh identity.

**Keep the output secret.** Anyone with the private key can impersonate your node.

The BBS service must **not** be running on the same serial port.

> **Not available on KISS Modem devices.** The KISS firmware exposes no way to read the private key, so with `connection_type = "kiss"` this command refuses with an explanatory error rather than connecting. A KISS node's identity cannot be backed up or moved to a replacement board — reflashing gives the BBS a new identity. See [ADR-0014](adr/0014-native-meshcore-stack-for-kiss-modems.md).

```sh
supply-drop-bbs node export-key
# 7f3a1b... (64 hex chars — keep secret)
```

---

### `node import-key`

```
supply-drop-bbs node import-key <KEY> [OPTIONS]
```

Import a 64-character hex key into the companion device as its new private key. The device's mesh identity changes immediately. The corresponding public key (shown by `node show-key`) will change to match.

Use this to:
- Restore a backed-up key after a firmware flash
- Migrate an identity from one device to another
- Set a specific node key when deploying pre-provisioned hardware

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<KEY>` | 64 hex characters (32 bytes). Must be valid hexadecimal. |

```sh
supply-drop-bbs node import-key ab12cd34ef56...
# key imported — node identity updated
```

**Exit codes:** `0` on success; `1` if the key is invalid, the port cannot be opened, or the device does not confirm the import.

> **Not available on KISS Modem devices.** The KISS firmware exposes no way to replace the private key, so with `connection_type = "kiss"` this command refuses with an explanatory error. See [ADR-0014](adr/0014-native-meshcore-stack-for-kiss-modems.md).

> **Web admin:** The same operation is available in the Settings page → **Node identity** → click the ✏️ icon next to the public key.

---

### `node set-radio`

```
supply-drop-bbs node set-radio [OPTIONS]
```

Push radio parameters (frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate, TX
power) to the companion device over USB serial. The device persists these
settings in its own flash; you only need to run this command when you want to
change them.

The BBS service must **not** be running on the same serial port when you run
this command.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--preset <NAME>` | Named region preset (e.g. `"USA/Canada"`). Overrides `config.toml` preset. |
| `--frequency-hz <N>` | Carrier frequency in Hz. Overrides preset. |
| `--bandwidth-hz <N>` | Channel bandwidth in Hz. Overrides preset. |
| `--spreading-factor <N>` | LoRa spreading factor 7–12. Overrides preset. |
| `--coding-rate <N>` | Coding rate denominator 5–8. Overrides preset. |
| `--tx-power-dbm <N>` | Transmit power in dBm. Overrides preset. |
| `--save` | Write the resolved parameters back to `config.toml`. |
| `--list-presets` | Print all available preset names and exit (does not open the port). |
| `--port <PATH>` | Serial port (e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0`, `COM3`). Defaults to the port in `config.toml`. |
| `--baud <N>` | Baud rate. Defaults to `config.toml` value or `115200`. |

**Examples:**

```sh
# List available region presets
supply-drop-bbs node set-radio --list-presets

# Apply the preset stored in config.toml (no flags needed)
supply-drop-bbs node set-radio \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml

# Apply a specific preset and save it to config.toml
supply-drop-bbs node set-radio --preset "USA/Canada" --save \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml

# Apply fully custom parameters without using a preset
supply-drop-bbs node set-radio \
  --frequency-hz 910525000 --bandwidth-hz 62500 \
  --spreading-factor 7 --coding-rate 5 --tx-power-dbm 20 \
  --save --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
```

**Exit codes:** `0` on success; `1` if a parameter is out of range, the port
cannot be opened, or the device does not confirm the command.

> **Config reference:** Radio parameters are stored in
> [`[plugins.mesh.radio]`](CONFIG.md#radio-parameter-configuration-pluginsmeshradio)
> in `config.toml`. Saving them there allows `node set-radio` (with no flags)
> to re-apply the same settings after a firmware flash.

---

### `user promote`

```
supply-drop-bbs user promote <USERNAME> [OPTIONS]
```

Promote a user account to **Sysop** (permission level 100). The BBS service does not need to be restarted - the change takes effect the next time the user logs in or issues a command.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<USERNAME>` | BBS username to promote (case-sensitive) |

```sh
supply-drop-bbs user promote alice
# alice promoted to sysop (level 100)

sudo supply-drop-bbs user promote alice \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
```

**Exit codes:** `0` on success; `1` if the user is not found or the database cannot be opened.

> **Aide level:** There is currently no `--aide` flag. To promote to Aide (level 50) instead of Sysop, use the in-BBS `.EU <username>` command as a Sysop, or update the database directly:
>
> ```sh
> sudo sqlite3 /var/lib/supply-drop-bbs/bbs.sqlite \
>   "UPDATE users SET permission_level = 50 WHERE username = 'alice';"
> ```

---

### `user demote`

```
supply-drop-bbs user demote <USERNAME> [OPTIONS]
```

Demote a user account back to **User** (permission level 10). Removes Sysop or Aide privileges. The change takes effect the next time the user issues a command.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<USERNAME>` | BBS username to demote (case-sensitive) |

```sh
supply-drop-bbs user demote alice
# alice demoted to user (level 10)
```

**Exit codes:** `0` on success; `1` if the user is not found or the database cannot be opened.

---

### `user set-password`

```
supply-drop-bbs user set-password <USERNAME> [OPTIONS]
```

Reset a user's password without requiring the old password. Prompts for the new password interactively (input is hidden) and asks for confirmation. The BBS service does not need to be stopped.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<USERNAME>` | BBS username whose password will be reset (case-sensitive) |

```sh
sudo supply-drop-bbs user set-password alice \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
# New password for alice: ••••••••
# Confirm password:       ••••••••
# password reset for alice
```

The new password must be at least 6 characters. The same operation is available in the **web admin UI** — open the user's detail drawer on the Users page and click **reset password** (sysop-only; requires the BBS to be running).

**Exit codes:** `0` on success; `1` if the user is not found, the password is too short, or the database cannot be opened.

---

## Permission levels

| Level | Value | How to set |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Unvalidated | 0 | Assigned on registration; cannot log into BBS features until validated |
| User | 10 | `user demote` or in-BBS `.EU` |
| Aide | 50 | In-BBS `.EU` as Sysop, or direct DB update |
| Sysop | 100 | `user promote` or in-BBS `.EU` as Sysop |

The first account registered on a fresh installation is automatically promoted to Sysop.

---

## Common workflows

### Bootstrap a new installation

```sh
# First user self-promotes to Sysop automatically on registration.
# If you need to promote a second sysop:
sudo supply-drop-bbs user promote alice \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
```

### Recover lost sysop access

```sh
sudo systemctl stop supply-drop-bbs
sudo supply-drop-bbs user promote alice \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
sudo systemctl start supply-drop-bbs
```

### Reset a user's password

If the BBS is running and you are logged into the web admin as a sysop, open the **Users** page, click the username to open the detail drawer, and use the **reset password** form.

If the web UI is unavailable, use the CLI (the BBS does not need to be stopped):

```sh
sudo supply-drop-bbs user set-password alice \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml
```

### Verify config before restarting

```sh
supply-drop-bbs config check --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml \
  && sudo systemctl restart supply-drop-bbs
```

### Run a local dev instance

```sh
cargo build
mkdir -p dev-data
./target/debug/supply-drop-bbs run \
  --config dev-config.toml \
  --data-dir dev-data \
  --log-level debug
```
