# Configuration reference

Every configuration knob Supply Drop BBS exposes, with type, default,
and behaviour. The example file at
[`config.example.toml`](../config.example.toml) is a runnable
starting point; this document is the dictionary.

> **Status:** stub. Each section will be fleshed out as the
> corresponding code lands. Sections marked **TBD** are
> placeholders.

## Format and overlay

Format: TOML. See
[ADR-0008](adr/0008-toml-config-with-env-overrides.md).

Configuration sources, in increasing priority:

1. Compiled-in defaults
2. The TOML file (resolved per the search order in `[file
   resolution](#file-resolution)`)
3. Environment variables
4. Command-line flags

Each source can override settings from a lower-priority source.
Operators see what's actually in effect via:

```sh
supply-drop-bbs config show
```

## File resolution

The first file found in this order is used:

1. The path given to `--config <PATH>` on the command line
2. The path given by the `SUPPLY_DROP_CONFIG` environment variable
3. `./config.toml` (the current working directory)
4. `/etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml` (system install)
5. `~/.config/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml` (user install)

If none of these exist and no `init` flag is set, the BBS exits
with an error pointing at the recommended location.

## Environment variable overrides

Pattern: `SUPPLY_DROP__SECTION__KEY=value`. Double underscores
separate hierarchy levels.

Examples:

| Env var                                  | Equivalent TOML                          |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `SUPPLY_DROP__BBS__NAME="Foo BBS"`       | `[bbs]` `name = "Foo BBS"`               |
| `SUPPLY_DROP__DATABASE__PATH=/srv/bbs.db`| `[database]` `path = "/srv/bbs.db"`      |
| `SUPPLY_DROP__LOGGING__LEVEL=DEBUG`      | `[logging]` `level = "DEBUG"`            |
| `SUPPLY_DROP__PLUGINS__WEB__BIND=:8080`  | `[plugins.web]` `bind = ":8080"`         |

Values are parsed using TOML's coercion rules. A bare integer
`8080` becomes the integer `8080`; a quoted string `"8080"`
becomes the string. Booleans use TOML conventions (`true`/`false`).

## Command-line flags

The CLI accepts a small set of overrides:

| Flag                    | Effect                                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `--config <PATH>`       | Use this config file                                |
| `--data-dir <PATH>`     | Override `[bbs] data_dir`                           |
| `--log-level <LEVEL>`   | Override `[logging] level` (announced loudly)        |
| `--bind-cli <PATH>`     | Override `[plugins.cli] socket`                     |
| `--bind-web <ADDR>`     | Override `[plugins.web] bind` (only if web feature) |
| `--no-web`              | Disable the web plugin even if the feature is built |

Subcommands:

- `supply-drop-bbs setup` - interactive setup wizard (device type, radio config, systemd install)
- `supply-drop-bbs config check` - validate config without starting
- `supply-drop-bbs config show` - print the effective config
- `supply-drop-bbs migrate` - apply pending DB migrations
- `supply-drop-bbs backup` - trigger a manual backup
- `supply-drop-bbs version` - print version + features compiled in

## Top-level sections

The config is split into the following top-level sections:

| Section                | Purpose                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `[bbs]`                | System identity, data paths, room defaults        |
| `[location]`           | GPS coordinates broadcast to the radio on connect |
| `[database]`           | DB path, pool sizes, PRAGMA overrides             |
| `[logging]`            | Level, file path, rotation, per-target overrides  |
| `[security]`           | Argon2 parameters, session lifetimes, rate limits |
| `[backup]`             | Schedule, retention, target directory             |
| `[plugins.cli]`        | CLI transport: socket path, permissions           |
| `[plugins.mesh]`       | Mesh transport: bridge address, retry policy      |
| `[plugins.web]`        | Web admin: bind, CSRF, CSP, config editor path    |
| `[plugins.<other>]`    | Per-plugin sections for any other loaded plugins  |

Sections referencing plugins not loaded at compile time are an
error (typo protection). The compiled-in feature set determines
which plugin sections are valid.

## `[bbs]` - system identity

| Key              | Type   | Default                  | Required | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------|--------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `name`           | string | `"Supply Drop BBS"`      | no       | Display name shown to users on connect           |
| `data_dir`       | path   | `/var/lib/supply-drop-bbs` (root) or `~/.local/share/supply-drop-bbs` (user) | no | Where the BBS stores its data |
| `starting_room`  | string | `"Lobby"`                | no       | Room a newly logged-in user lands in             |
| `welcome_msg`    | string | `"Welcome to {name}."`   | no       | Banner shown on connect; supports `{name}` substitution |
| `timezone`       | string | `"UTC"`                  | no       | Display timezone for sysop UI; storage is always UTC |
| `require_verify` | bool   | `true`                   | no       | When `false`, skip sysop verification — new accounts are treated as `User` immediately (SHTF mode) |
| `guest_room`     | string | (unset)                  | no       | Name of a room unverified users are allowed into; created automatically on startup if it does not exist |

### Access control and SHTF mode

By default every new account must be validated by an aide or sysop before the
user can post or read messages.  In emergency situations (sysops unreachable)
two knobs relax this:

**Open access (`require_verify = false`)** — all registrations immediately
receive full User-level access.  No aide or sysop action is required.

```toml
[bbs]
require_verify = false
```

**Guest room (`guest_room = "Guests"`)** — unverified users are placed in a
single designated room and can read and post there, but all other rooms and
mail are invisible until a sysop verifies them.  The room is created
automatically on the first BBS start after this key is set.

```toml
[bbs]
guest_room = "Guests"
```

The two options compose: with `require_verify = false` the guest room still
exists as an ordinary room but carries no access restriction.

Both settings can be changed without a restart via in-BBS sysop commands:

```
OPENACCESS              # disable verification immediately
CLOSEACCESS             # restore verification immediately
GUESTROOM Guests        # set guest room (created if needed)
GUESTROOM OFF           # disable guest room
```

…or via the CLI (takes effect on the next restart):

```sh
supply-drop-bbs config require-verify off
supply-drop-bbs config guest-room "Guests"
supply-drop-bbs config guest-room off
```

## `[location]` - GPS coordinates

When set, the mesh transport sends your node's coordinates to the radio
immediately after each connection is established, so it appears on the
MeshCore map in LoRa adverts. **Takes effect on the next mesh transport
reconnect — no server restart needed.**

| Key         | Type  | Default | Required | Description                          |
|-------------|-------|---------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `latitude`  | float | (unset) | no       | WGS-84 latitude, degrees (-90…90)    |
| `longitude` | float | (unset) | no       | WGS-84 longitude, degrees (-180…180) |

Both keys must be set together; setting only one has no effect.
Remove both (or omit the section) to stop broadcasting GPS coordinates.

The setup wizard prompts for these during initial configuration and
writes them here. They can also be edited live from the web admin's
**Settings** page without restarting the server.

```toml
[location]
latitude  = 37.7749
longitude = -122.4194
```

## `[database]` - persistence

| Key                       | Type    | Default                 | Required | Description                          |
|---------------------------|---------|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `path`                    | path    | `<data_dir>/bbs.sqlite` | no       | SQLite file location                 |
| `read_pool_size`          | integer | `cpu_count + 2`         | no       | Read-only connection pool size       |
| `busy_timeout_ms`         | integer | `5000`                  | no       | SQLite busy_timeout in milliseconds  |
| `synchronous`             | enum    | `"NORMAL"`              | no       | `"NORMAL"` / `"FULL"` / `"OFF"`. See [ADR-0005](adr/0005-db-strategy.md). |
| `wal_autocheckpoint`      | integer | `10000`                 | no       | WAL pages between checkpoints        |
| `journal_size_limit_bytes`| integer | `67108864`              | no       | Max WAL file size                    |

## `[logging]` - observability

| Key                | Type    | Default                                     | Required | Description                       |
|--------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `level`            | enum    | `"INFO"`                                    | no       | Root level: TRACE/DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR |
| `file`             | path    | `<data_dir>/log/bbs.log`                    | no       | Log file path                     |
| `max_bytes`        | integer | `10485760`                                  | no       | Rotation size per file (10 MB)    |
| `backup_count`     | integer | `5`                                         | no       | Number of rotated files to keep   |
| `format`           | enum    | `"compact"`                                 | no       | `"compact"`, `"pretty"`, `"json"` |
| `targets`          | table   | `{}`                                        | no       | Per-target level overrides; see below |

Per-target overrides example:

```toml
[logging.targets]
"bbs_mesh" = "DEBUG"                  # MeshCore transport (whole crate)
"sqlx::query" = "INFO"
"meshcore_companion::frame" = "WARN"
```

Targets are Rust module paths. First-party code lives in per-crate paths
(`bbs_mesh`, `bbs_meshtastic`, `bbs_core`, `bbs_web`, `meshcore_companion`, and
the `supply_drop_bbs` binary), so target the crate (or a module within it, e.g.
`bbs_mesh::transport`) — not a single `supply_drop_bbs::*` prefix.

See [ADR-0009](adr/0009-tracing-config-respected.md) for the
no-silent-overrides rule.

## `[security]` - authentication and rate limiting

| Key                          | Type    | Default | Required | Description                          |
|------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `argon2_memory_kib`          | integer | `19456` | no       | Argon2 memory cost (~19 MB; tuned for ~250ms on Pi 4) |
| `argon2_iterations`          | integer | `2`     | no       | Argon2 time cost                     |
| `argon2_parallelism`         | integer | `1`     | no       | Argon2 parallelism                   |
| `session_lifetime_web_secs`  | integer | `43200` | no       | Web session lifetime (12 hours)      |
| `session_lifetime_mesh_secs` | integer | `259200`| no       | Mesh session lifetime (3 days)       |
| `login_rate_per_min`         | integer | `5`     | no       | Failed login attempts per minute per source |
| `command_rate_per_min`       | integer | `60`    | no       | Commands per minute per session       |

## `[backup]` - disaster recovery

| Key                | Type    | Default                       | Required | Description                       |
|--------------------|---------|-------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `enabled`          | bool    | `true`                        | no       | Whether the periodic backup runs  |
| `interval_hours`   | integer | `6`                           | no       | Hours between automatic backups   |
| `directory`        | path    | `<data_dir>/backups`          | no       | Where backup files go             |

## `[plugins.mesh]` - mesh transport

### Connection type

| Key                | Type   | Default    | Required | Description                                  |
|--------------------|--------|------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`          | bool   | `true`     | no       | Whether to start the mesh transport          |
| `connection_type`  | enum   | `"serial"` | no       | How to reach the radio: `"serial"`, `"tcp"`, `"hat"`, or `"kiss"`. See [ADR-0013](adr/0013-native-serial-transport-for-usb-devices.md) and [ADR-0014](adr/0014-native-meshcore-stack-for-kiss-modems.md). |
| `command_prefix`   | string | `""`       | no       | Optional single-character prefix for BBS commands (e.g., `"!"`). Empty string means no prefix - every message is treated as a command. |

### Reply delivery

On a multi-hop mesh the return path is lossy, so a reply can be dropped even
though the BBS processed the command. These keys make replies more likely to
arrive.

| Key                 | Type    | Default | Required | Description                                     |
|---------------------|---------|---------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `flood_after_send`  | bool    | `true`  | no       | Reset the node's stored path after each send so the next message floods (hop-by-hop) rather than using a possibly-stale direct route. |
| `reply_max_attempts`| integer | `1`     | no       | Total transmissions per reply, including the first. `1` (the default) disables retransmission. When > 1, the transport tracks each reply's delivery via the device's send-result CRC and delivery confirmation and retransmits — up to this many attempts — if no confirmation arrives in time. **Only raise this on a link that confirms deliveries — see the warning below.** |
| `workflow_timeout_secs`| integer | `300` | no       | Seconds a node may sit awaiting a workflow reply before the transport cancels the stale workflow and treats the node's next message as a fresh command. On a lossy multi-hop link a prompt reply (e.g. "Choose a password:") can be lost, stranding the node — every message it then sends is consumed as workflow input whose "try again" response is *also* lost, and only `cancel` breaks the loop. The timer is reset per workflow *stage* (a changed prompt), so a legitimately-progressing multi-step flow is not cut short. `0` disables the timeout. |
| `path_bytes`        | integer | `3`     | no       | Bytes each hop adds to a flooded packet's routing path (MeshCore's path-hash width): `2` or `3`. More bytes make path-hash collisions — and the mis-routes they cause — less likely on a dense mesh, at the cost of a little more airtime per packet and a lower maximum hop count. Pushed to the radio on every connect. Values other than `2` or `3` are clamped into range. Also settable via the setup wizard ("MeshCore routing"), the web admin **Settings → MeshCore radio** page, or per-device with `supply-drop-bbs node set-path-bytes <2\|3>` (add `--save` to also write it here). |
| `advert_on_connect` | bool    | `true`  | no       | Broadcast a self-advert each time the radio (re)connects. An advert is how other nodes and repeaters discover the BBS and learn (or refresh) a route back to it, so advertising on connect means the mesh relearns the BBS promptly after a restart or link blip rather than waiting for the radio firmware's own advert schedule (which a companion device may run rarely). Adverts are flooded so they propagate mesh-wide. **In addition, the BBS broadcasts a periodic flood advert once every 24 hours on a fixed schedule — this is not configurable.** |

> **Check the confirm rate before enabling retransmission.** Retransmission
> relies on the radio returning an end-to-end delivery confirmation
> (`PUSH_CODE_SEND_CONFIRMED`). On a link that never confirms — some multi-hop
> or bridge setups never surface one, giving a **0% confirm rate** — the
> transport cannot distinguish a delivered reply from a lost one, so it

> non-zero. Latency and the per-node breakdown also populate only when
> `reply_max_attempts > 1`.
>
> **At-least-once delivery.** Even on a healthy link, a confirmation lost on the
> return path can cause the BBS to retransmit a reply the user already received
> — a duplicate message is preferable to silence, and inbound commands are
> deduplicated separately. The per-attempt wait is the device's own timeout
> hint, clamped to the 4–30 s range.

### Serial mode (`connection_type = "serial"`)

Used for USB-native MeshCore devices (Heltec V3, T-Beam, etc.) that
run companion-frame firmware. No `pymc_core` required.

| Key           | Type    | Default          | Required | Description                              |
|---------------|---------|------------------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `serial_port` | string  | `"/dev/ttyACM0"` | no       | Serial device path. The setup wizard auto-detects this. |
| `baud_rate`   | integer | `115200`         | no       | Serial baud rate                         |

### KISS mode (`connection_type = "kiss"`)

Used for USB devices running MeshCore **KISS Modem** firmware. No `pymc_core`
required. The device is a raw-PHY TNC, so the BBS runs the MeshCore node stack
itself and delegates every cryptographic operation back to the device. See
[ADR-0014](adr/0014-native-meshcore-stack-for-kiss-modems.md).

Uses the same `serial_port` and `baud_rate` keys as serial mode.

Companion firmware keeps its contact table in the radio's flash; a KISS modem
does not, so the BBS persists contacts itself to `contacts_path`. Without it the
BBS would forget every node's stored return path on restart and could not reply
until each node adverted again. The file is rewritten at most every 30 seconds
and only when something changed, so it does not hammer an SD card. When the
table is full the contact heard longest ago is evicted first. Cached shared
secrets are never written to disk; they are re-derived on demand.

The node's identity lives in the device's flash. The KISS firmware exposes no
private-key export, so a KISS-mode identity cannot be backed up or moved to a
replacement board, and `node export-key` / `node import-key` refuse rather than
operate on a different key.

CSMA and scope settings live in their own table:

| Key            | Type    | Default | Required | Description                              |
|----------------|---------|---------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `tx_delay_ms`  | integer | `500`   | no       | Transmitter keyup delay. Rounded down to the KISS 10 ms unit. |
| `persistence`  | integer | `63`    | no       | CSMA persistence, 0-255. Higher transmits sooner once the channel is clear. |
| `slot_time_ms` | integer | `100`   | no       | CSMA slot interval. Rounded down to the KISS 10 ms unit. |
| `tx_tail_ms`   | integer | `0`     | no       | Post-transmit hold time. Rounded down to the KISS 10 ms unit. |
| `full_duplex`  | bool    | `false` | no       | Bypass CSMA. Leave off for a half-duplex radio, which is every supported LoRa board. |
| `flood_scope`  | string  | (unset) | no       | Region name for meshes that scope their traffic. Also settable via the web admin **Settings → MeshCore radio** page. |
| `contacts_path`| path    | `<data_dir>/meshcore-contacts.json` | no | Where the contact table is kept between runs. |
| `max_contacts` | integer | `10000` | no       | Contacts to keep before evicting the one heard longest ago. |

`flood_scope` matters on a mesh that scopes its traffic: repeaters there drop any
flooded packet whose transport code they cannot reproduce, so the BBS must
transmit under the same scope to be heard at all. The key is `SHA256("#<name>")`
truncated to sixteen bytes, so `flood_scope = "nl"` and `flood_scope = "#nl"`
are the same scope. Leave it unset on an unscoped mesh.

The name must carry no whitespace or control characters — the whole mesh has to
derive the same key from it, and a stray character produces one nobody else
derives, leaving the BBS silently unheard. The derived key is logged on connect
as `kiss: flood scope active`, so it can be compared against another node's.

```toml
[plugins.mesh]
connection_type = "kiss"
serial_port     = "/dev/ttyACM0"

[plugins.mesh.kiss]
flood_scope = "nl"
```

### TCP / HAT mode (`connection_type = "tcp"` or `"hat"`)

Used when `pymc_core` is running separately (Pi HAT setups or any
external `CompanionFrameServer`). `"hat"` and `"tcp"` are identical at
the transport level; the distinction tells the setup wizard to install
`pymc_core` as a systemd dependency.

| Key                          | Type    | Default            | Required | Description                                             |
|------------------------------|---------|--------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `addr`                       | string  | `"127.0.0.1:5000"` | no       | Address of the `CompanionFrameServer`                   |
| `reconnect_delay_initial_ms` | integer | `1000`             | no       | Initial reconnect delay after disconnect (ms)           |
| `reconnect_delay_max_ms`     | integer | `60000`            | no       | Maximum reconnect delay after repeated failures (ms). Backoff is exponential between initial and max. |
| `app_target_version`         | integer | `3`                | no       | Companion protocol version to negotiate. Leave at default unless you know the bridge speaks an older version. |

### HAT pin configuration (`connection_type = "hat"`)

Pin config lives under `[plugins.mesh.hat]`. The setup wizard
populates this from the chosen preset; manual overrides are supported.

| Key                 | Type    | Default | Required | Description                                     |
|---------------------|---------|---------|----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `preset`            | string  | -       | yes (hat)| HAT model: `"zebrahat"`, `"meshadv-mini"`, `"meshadv"`, `"waveshare"`, `"uconsole"`, `"custom"` |
| `bus_id`            | integer | `0`     | no       | SPI bus                                         |
| `cs_pin`            | integer | -       | custom   | SPI chip-select GPIO (BCM numbering)            |
| `reset_pin`         | integer | -       | custom   | Radio reset GPIO                                |
| `busy_pin`          | integer | -       | custom   | Radio busy GPIO                                 |
| `irq_pin`           | integer | -       | custom   | Radio IRQ GPIO                                  |
| `txen_pin`          | integer | `-1`    | no       | TX-enable GPIO (`-1` = not connected)           |
| `rxen_pin`          | integer | `-1`    | no       | RX-enable GPIO (`-1` = not connected)           |

Preset defaults (set automatically by the wizard; override only if
your wiring differs from the standard layout):

| Preset        | CS | Reset | Busy | IRQ | Notes                        |
|---------------|----|-------|------|-----|------------------------------|
| `zebrahat`    | 24 | 17    | 27   | 22  |                              |
| `meshadv-mini`| 8  | 24    | 20   | 16  |                              |
| `meshadv`     | 21 | 18    | 20   | 16  | TXEN=13, RXEN=12             |
| `waveshare`   | 21 | 18    | 20   | 16  | TXEN=13, RXEN=12             |
| `uconsole`    | -1 | 25    | 24   | 26  | bus_id=1, hardware CS        |

### Radio parameter configuration (`[plugins.mesh.radio]`)

Stores the LoRa parameters the BBS pushes to the companion device — resolved
and applied automatically on every connect (skipped when they already match
what the device reports; see [Applying radio parameters](#applying-radio-parameters)
below), or on demand via `supply-drop-bbs node set-radio`. The device persists
radio settings in its own flash.

Either specify a named `preset` (which fills all five parameters at once) or
supply individual fields. Individual fields take precedence over the preset; you
can mix them to override a single value while keeping the rest of the preset.

| Key                | Type    | Default  | Required | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|---------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `preset`           | string  | (unset)  | no       | Named region preset. Run `node set-radio --list-presets` to see all names. |
| `frequency_hz`     | integer | (unset)  | no       | Carrier frequency in Hz. Overrides the preset value when set. Example: `910_525_000` for 910.525 MHz. |
| `bandwidth_hz`     | integer | (unset)  | no       | Channel bandwidth in Hz. Overrides the preset value. Example: `62_500` for 62.5 kHz. |
| `spreading_factor` | integer | (unset)  | no       | LoRa spreading factor, `7`–`12`. Higher values = longer range, lower data rate. |
| `coding_rate`      | integer | (unset)  | no       | LoRa coding rate denominator, `5`–`8` (representing 4/5 through 4/8). |
| `tx_power_dbm`     | integer | (unset)  | no       | Transmit power in dBm. Overrides the preset value.           |

#### Available presets

Run `supply-drop-bbs node set-radio --list-presets` for the current list. At the
time of writing the built-in presets are:

| Preset name           | Frequency    | Bandwidth | SF | CR | TX power |
|-----------------------|--------------|-----------|----|----|----------|
| `Australia`           | 915.800 MHz  | 250 kHz   | 10 | 5  | 20 dBm   |
| `Australia (Narrow)`  | 916.575 MHz  | 62.5 kHz  | 7  | 5  | 20 dBm   |

| `USA/Canada`          | 910.525 MHz  | 62.5 kHz  | 7  | 5  | 20 dBm   |
| `Vietnam`             | 920.250 MHz  | 250 kHz   | 11 | 5  | 20 dBm   |
| `Off-Grid 433`        | 433.000 MHz  | 250 kHz   | 11 | 8  | 20 dBm   |
| `Off-Grid 869`        | 869.000 MHz  | 250 kHz   | 11 | 8  | 14 dBm   |
| `Off-Grid 918`        | 918.000 MHz  | 250 kHz   | 11 | 8  | 20 dBm   |

#### Examples

**Using a preset (recommended for most deployments):**

```toml
[plugins.mesh.radio]
preset = "USA/Canada"
```

**Custom parameters (all fields required when no preset is given):**

```toml
[plugins.mesh.radio]
frequency_hz     = 910_525_000
bandwidth_hz     = 62_500
spreading_factor = 7
coding_rate      = 5
tx_power_dbm     = 20
```

**Preset with one override (increase TX power beyond the preset default):**

```toml
[plugins.mesh.radio]
preset       = "EU/UK (Long Range)"
tx_power_dbm = 17
```

#### Applying radio parameters

**Saving a `[plugins.mesh.radio]` section and restarting the BBS is enough** —
the transport resolves it (preset + field overrides) and pushes a correction to
the device on every connect, whenever the resolved values differ from what the
device reports. The write is skipped when they already match, since writing
radio params re-inits the device's RF chip; a restart with an unchanged section
is a no-op on the wire. This applies *before* any other radio operation (the
message-queue drain, contact fetch, autoadd query), the same way `path_bytes`
and the advert name/GPS are synced on every startup.

The CLI is for applying (or previewing) a change **without** starting the BBS —
useful before the service is installed, for a one-off preset test, or to
resolve a preset into concrete values and `--save` them back into
`config.toml`:

```sh
# BBS must not be running — it holds the serial port open.
sudo systemctl stop supply-drop-bbs

# Apply using the preset stored in config.toml:
supply-drop-bbs node set-radio \
  --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml

# Apply a one-off preset without changing config.toml:
supply-drop-bbs node set-radio --preset "EU/UK (Narrow)"

# Apply fully custom parameters and save them to config.toml:
supply-drop-bbs node set-radio \
  --frequency-hz 910525000 --bandwidth-hz 62500 \
  --spreading-factor 7 --coding-rate 5 --tx-power-dbm 20 \
  --save --config /etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml

sudo systemctl start supply-drop-bbs
```

The setup wizard (`supply-drop-bbs setup`) also offers radio configuration and
writes the chosen settings to `config.toml`; the BBS applies them itself on
its next connect, as above.

#### Node identity (`[plugins.mesh]` — node key)

The BBS's mesh identity is a 32-byte Ed25519 key pair stored on the companion
device. The public key is what other MeshCore nodes use to address messages to
your BBS.

| Operation | How |
|-----------|-----|
| **View public key** | `supply-drop-bbs node show-key` or web admin **Settings** → Node identity |
| **Back up private key** | `supply-drop-bbs node export-key` (keep the output secret) |
| **Restore / migrate private key** | `supply-drop-bbs node import-key <64-hex-chars>` or web admin **Settings** → Node identity → ✏️ |

The BBS service must **not** be running when using these commands — it holds
the serial port open.

See the [CLI Reference](CLI.md#node-show-key) for full flag documentation.

## `[plugins.meshtastic]` - Meshtastic transport (only if `transport-meshtastic` feature enabled)

Meshtastic is a separate radio protocol from MeshCore. Both can run simultaneously
on the same BBS — each talks to its own radio device. Meshtastic radios connect
either via USB serial or TCP to a running `meshtasticd` instance.

### Connection type

| Key                | Type   | Default    | Required | Description                                         |
|--------------------|--------|------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|

| `connection_type`  | enum   | `"serial"` | no       | How to reach the radio: `"serial"` or `"tcp"`      |
| `command_prefix`   | string | (unset)    | no       | Optional single-character prefix for BBS commands   |
| `welcome_message`  | string | see default | no      | Greeting sent to a node on first contact            |

| `reconnect_delay_max_ms`     | integer | `60000`| no | Maximum reconnect delay after repeated failures    |

### Serial mode (`connection_type = "serial"`)

Direct USB connection to a Meshtastic radio (Heltec V3, T-Beam, RAK4631, etc.).
No daemon required.

| Key           | Type    | Default          | Required | Description           |
|---------------|---------|------------------|----------|-----------------------|
| `serial_port` | string  | `"/dev/ttyACM0"` | no       | Serial device path    |
| `baud_rate`   | integer | `115200`         | no       | Serial baud rate      |

### TCP mode (`connection_type = "tcp"`)

Connects to a running `meshtasticd` instance or any Meshtastic node that exposes
a TCP stream. Default port for `meshtasticd` is `4403`.

| Key    | Type   | Default            | Required | Description                 |
|--------|--------|--------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| `addr` | string | `"127.0.0.1:4403"` | no       | Address of the meshtasticd listener |

### Node name

| Key          | Type   | Default | Required | Description                                              |
|--------------|--------|---------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `long_name`  | string | (unset) | no       | Node long name shown on mesh maps (≤ 39 chars)           |
| `short_name` | string | (unset) | no       | Node short name shown on OLED / maps (≤ 4 chars)         |

### Radio settings — `[plugins.meshtastic.radio]`

These are pushed to the connected device automatically when the BBS connects,
so changes made here (or in the web **Settings** page) take effect on the next
connect. Writes are **skipped when the value already matches the device**, so the
radio only reboots when something actually changed.

| Key               | Type    | Default     | Required | Description                                                        |
|-------------------|---------|-------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `region`          | string  | (unset)     | no       | Region code, e.g. `"US"`, `"EU_868"`, `"ANZ"`. Leave unset to keep the device's current region. |
| `modem_preset`    | string  | `"LONG_FAST"` | no     | LoRa modem preset, e.g. `"LONG_FAST"`, `"MEDIUM_SLOW"`             |
| `hops`            | integer | `3`         | no       | Max hops for packets this node originates                          |
| `rx_boosted_gain` | bool    | `true`      | no       | SX126x RX boosted gain (improves receive sensitivity)              |
| `ignore_mqtt`     | bool    | `true`      | no       | Ignore packets that arrived over MQTT                              |
| `tx_enabled`      | bool    | `true`      | no       | Whether the radio transmitter is enabled                           |

On connect the BBS also:

- **syncs the device clock** to system time,
- **sets a fixed GPS position** from the `[location]` config (or clears it when no
  location is configured), and
- sets the device's `node_info_broadcast_secs` to **3600 s (1 h, the firmware
  minimum)** so the node re-announces itself to the mesh hourly. This is the
  firmware-native way neighbouring nodes discover the BBS; you can also force an
  immediate re-announce with the **"reboot radio"** button on the Settings page.

### Example

```toml
[plugins.meshtastic]
enabled         = true
connection_type = "serial"
serial_port     = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
long_name       = "Supply Drop BBS"
short_name      = "SDB"

[plugins.meshtastic.radio]
region          = "US"
modem_preset    = "LONG_FAST"
hops            = 3
rx_boosted_gain = true
ignore_mqtt     = true
tx_enabled      = true
```

## `[plugins.web]` - admin web (only if `admin-web` feature enabled)

| Key                     | Type    | Default                | Required | Description                                |
|-------------------------|---------|------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`               | bool    | `true`                 | no       | Whether to start the web listener (set false to disable without recompiling) |
| `bind`                  | string  | `"127.0.0.1:8080"`     | no       | Address to bind. **Default 127.0.0.1.**    |
| `external_origin`       | string  | (none)                 | when behind reverse proxy | Public origin URL for CSRF / cookie policy |
| `cookie_secure`         | bool    | `true`                 | no       | `Secure` flag on cookies. Set false only for local dev. |
| `prometheus`            | bool    | `false`                | no       | Expose `/metrics`                          |
| `csp`                   | string  | (built-in strict CSP)  | no       | Content-Security-Policy override           |
| `config_path`           | path    | (none)                 | no       | Absolute path to the config file the web admin's **Settings** page reads and writes. Must be writable by the server process. When unset, the Settings page loads in read-only mode and explains the gap. |

### Enabling the Settings page

The **Settings** page (`/settings` in the web admin) lets sysops view and
edit the config file through a form UI without touching the TOML directly.
Point `config_path` at the same file the BBS is reading:

```toml
[plugins.web]
config_path = "/etc/supply-drop-bbs/config.toml"
```

The server process must have write permission to that file. If it does not,
the Settings page opens in read-only mode and shows the exact `chown`/`chmod`
commands needed to fix the permission. Changes written through the UI require
a restart to take effect (the GPS `[location]` section is the one exception —
it applies on the next mesh reconnect).

If `bind` is `0.0.0.0` and `external_origin` is unset, startup
fails with an error: binding to all interfaces without specifying
the public origin makes CSRF protection unsafe.

## `[[plugins.process]]` - externally-spawned transport plugins (only if `transport-process` feature enabled)

Process transport plugins are external executables that speak the Supply Drop
IPC protocol over stdin/stdout. Each plugin is a separate entry in an array
table. Manage them with `supply-drop-bbs plugin add/remove/enable/disable` or
directly in the web admin UI.

```toml
[[plugins.process]]
name              = "my-telnet"           # unique stable identifier
command           = "/usr/local/bin/my-telnet-plugin"
args              = ["--port", "23"]      # optional
enabled           = true
restart_on_crash  = true                  # respawn automatically on non-zero exit
restart_delay_secs = 5                    # seconds to wait before respawn

[[plugins.process]]
name    = "my-aprs"
command = "/opt/aprs-bridge/aprs-bridge"
enabled = false                           # start disabled; enable via web UI
```

| Key                  | Type     | Default | Required | Description |
|----------------------|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `name`               | string   | —       | **yes**  | Unique stable identifier. Used in logs, web UI, and CLI output. Lowercase ASCII with hyphens. |
| `command`            | string   | —       | **yes**  | Path to the plugin executable. |

## Validation rules

Validation runs at startup, before any service starts. Failures
exit the process with a clear error message including:

- **TOML well-formedness.** Errors include `file:line:col`.
- **Required keys present.** Every field without a default fails
  with the missing path (e.g., `plugins.web.bind`).
- **Type correctness.** `8080` is not a string; `"foo"` is not a
  port.
- **Range checks.** Ports `1..=65535`; positive sizes; valid
  enum variants.
- **Cross-references.** Plugin sections must correspond to loaded
  plugins; referenced rooms must exist; backup directory must be
  writable.
- **Permission/ownership.** Files containing secrets must be
  mode 0600 or stricter on Unix.
- **Conflicting settings.** `bind = "0.0.0.0"` without
  `external_origin` is an error, not a warning.

## Sysop bootstrap

The first sysop account is created during `supply-drop-bbs init`.
It is **not** in the config file (passwords don't go in TOML).
The init flow prompts for username + password and creates the
account in the DB.

To bootstrap a sysop after init (e.g., when migrating between
machines), use:

```sh
supply-drop-bbs admin create-sysop --username <name>
```

This prompts for a password and creates the account, gated on
having direct DB write access (i.e., it requires running on the
machine, with read access to the DB file). It is not an HTTP
endpoint.

## Reload behaviour

Most config changes require a restart. The keys that **can** change
without restart are:

- `[logging] level` (via `SIGHUP`, future enhancement)
- `[security] login_rate_per_min` (via `SIGHUP`, future enhancement)

All other keys require a process restart. We document this on each
key as the implementation lands. **TBD.**
